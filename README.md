# Polaroid Site Version 0.1
## What is Polaroid Site 

The Polaroid site, also known as the 'Nomads Lighthouse Collection,' is part of my larger personal project called Nomads Backpack. Nomads Backpack is a web application that encompasses interactive websites, web games, 2D and 3D animations. The purpose of this project is to practice my coding and design skills while creating a foundation for something bigger in my future.
